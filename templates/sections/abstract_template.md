## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Word count: 300-500 words
- [ ] Contains all required elements (background, problem, method, innovation, results, conclusion)
- [ ] Includes quantitative results with specific numbers
- [ ] No vague or generic statements
- [ ] Professional academic tone
- [ ] No first-person pronouns (or minimal use of "we")
- [ ] Keywords are specific and relevant

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too vague**: "Our model performs well" → "Our model achieves 94% accuracy"
2. **Missing innovation**: Always highlight what's new
3. **No quantification**: Include specific numbers
4. **Too long/short**: Strict 300-500 word limit
5. **Missing keywords**: Always include 5-7 relevant keywords
